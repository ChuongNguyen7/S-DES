# S-DES
Simplified DES encryption algorithm implemented in C

Analysis of S-DES:

File Format
*  Master file name is cs468-filelist.txt
* Each file is named either plain-x.txt or
crypt-x.txt
* Where x is an integer
* Plain-x.txt contains plaintext
* Crypt-x.txt contains encrypted text
* Your output just reverses the file name
– E.g., if you read crypt-6.txt, your output file is named plain-6.txt

Operation
* Produce an executable file
* Open the file cs468-filelist.txt in the same directory
* Process each file in the list
* Write output in the same directory
* Example: cs468-filelist.txt contains the files plain-1.txt and crypt-4.txt
* Your program now writes two new files crypt-1.txt and plain-4.txt
* So there are now 5 files in the directory

File Format Conventions

* Master file name is filelist.txt 
* Each file is named either plain-x.txt or
crypt-x.txt
* Plain-x.txt contains plaintext
* Crypt-x.txt contains encrypted text
* Your outpubile just reverses the file name
*  E.g., if you read crypt-6.txt, your output file is named plain-6.txt
